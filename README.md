# Human-in-the-loop (HITL) showdown

This monorepo contains projects that implement the currently recommended (as of the latest commit) approach to implement HITL for different agentic frameworks.

More frameworks will be added with time.

All projects implement [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVsjZBmXdbI&t=1933s&ab_channel=Arcade) multi-agent system.

If the framework has a documented way to do HITL, I use it. If it doesn't I shoehorn it and then express my opinion [here](https://x.com/torresmateo) and [here](https://blog.arcade.dev/).
